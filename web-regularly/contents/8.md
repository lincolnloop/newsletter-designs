## "Web Design Regularly" is now "Web Regularly"

As browsers and devices become more capable, the frontend is rapidly expanding.
Engineering is increasingly becoming a major focus on the frontend, alongside
design. As you've probably noticed, we decided to expand our newsletter to
cover engineering articles we've enjoyed lately in addition to the great design
articles we highlight. To reflect this, we're changing the name to "Web
Regularly". We hope you enjoy the wider variety of frontend articles that we
will feature each issue. Thanks for reading!
